# Recyy-Task
This project is a dynamic New Year Countdown built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It tracks the time remaining until New Year's Eve, updating every second. Using JavaScript's Date object, the remaining time is calculated, and the updateCounter function ensures the countdown display refreshes every 1000 milliseconds via setInterval.

The layout is designed with a clean structure using flexbox and nested flexbox for proper alignment of elements. The interface includes input fields and buttons, styled with CSS to enhance the visual appeal. The design features hover effects and smooth color transitions for an interactive user experience. Additionally, a preview button is included to display a celebratory New Year message when clicked.
